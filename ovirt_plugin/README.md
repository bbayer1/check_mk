# ovirt Plugin

This plugin monitors a ovirt infrastructure using the ovirt api on the host system. 

It can monitor the hosts, snapshots, storage domains and general statistics. The statistics can be generated as piggyback data, just like [checkmk](https://checkmk.com/) does with the vmware agent. 

Additionaly compatibility issues with different cluster and engine versions after a cluster or engine update are monitored. 


It contains the [checkmk](https://checkmk.com/) Enterprise Edition feature for baking agents and wato GUIs for parameter definition.
